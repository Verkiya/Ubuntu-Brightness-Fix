 You just have to place the configuration file in "/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d" directory.
  
  For this, write commands written below one by one :-
  
  * cd /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
  
  * wget https://github.com/Verkiya/Ubuntu-Brightness-Fix/blob/master/20-intel.conf
  
  After that just logout/restart to check  whether brightness function is fixed or not.
